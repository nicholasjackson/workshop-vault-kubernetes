# Integrating HashiCorp Vault with Kubernetes: Enhancing Security Beyond Native Secrets

In the modern era of cloud-native applications and container orchestration, Kubernetes has emerged as the leading platform for managing containerized workloads. One of the crucial aspects of managing applications in Kubernetes is handling sensitive data, such as API keys, certificates, credentials, and other secrets. Kubernetes provides its own mechanism for managing secrets, but many organizations are opting to integrate with HashiCorp Vault. This workshop explores why integrating HashiCorp Vault with Kubernetes can be beneficial, how to ensure a secure integration, design considerations, available options from HashiCorp, and the recommended practices.

## Why Are We Integrating with HashiCorp Vault Anyway? Kubernetes Has Secrets!

Kubernetes Secrets is a built-in object for storing sensitive information. While it offers basic functionality, there are several reasons why organizations might seek a more robust solution like HashiCorp Vault:

1. **Enhanced Security Features**: Vault offers advanced security features such as dynamic secrets, leasing, revocation, and sophisticated access control policies. These features help minimize the risk of long-lived credentials and unauthorized access.

2. **Centralized Secret Management**: Vault serves as a centralized secrets management solution, enabling consistent security practices across different environments (e.g., on-premises, multi-cloud, hybrid cloud). This centralization simplifies operations and enhances automation.

3. **Dynamic Secrets**: Unlike static secrets stored in Kubernetes, Vault can generate dynamic secrets that are time-bound and automatically revoked, reducing the risk of credential leakage.

4. **Auditing and Logging**: Vault provides comprehensive auditing and logging capabilities, which are essential for monitoring access and usage of sensitive information.

## What Options Are Provided by HashiCorp and What Would I Need to Build Myself?

HashiCorp provides several features and tools to facilitate integration with Kubernetes:

1. **Vault Aware applications**: Applications themselves make direct calls to vault. 
2. **Vault Secret Operator**: Using Kuberentes centric approach of defining a custom resource that interfaces with Vault using standard kubernetes resources
3. **Vault Secret Injection**: inject secrets directly into Kubernetes pods, usually via annotations or side car proxies.
