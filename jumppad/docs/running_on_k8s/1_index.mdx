# Configuring Kubernetes authentication

In previous exercises you have been interacting with Vault using an admin token.
When running on a Kubernetes cluster you need to ensuret that the application
has been configured with the correct permissions to interact with Vault.

To secure access to it's API Vault uses a system of policies and roles. Policies
define what paths a token can access and what operations can be performed on those
paths. Roles define what policies are associated with an authentication endpoint.

Previously you authenticated with an existing token, this capability is not
practical in a production environment as it would require long lived tokens
to be deployed with each deployment.  To address this Vault provides the concept
of authentication endpoints.  These are endpoints that can be used to authenticate
to Vault using a known secret such as a Kubernetes service account token, a GitHub
token or a username and password.

To configure the authentication method for Kubernetes you will need the following
three things:

|      |      |
| ---- | ---- |
| `token_reviewer_jwt` | The JWT token that the Kubernetes service account uses to authenticate to the API server. |
| `kubernetes_host`    | The address of the Kubernetes API server. |
| `kubernetes_ca_cert` | The CA certificate used to validate the Kubernetes API server. |

The kubernetes secret `vault-k8s-auth-secret` in the `vault` namespace contains the details of the ca_cert and
the token.  

Before configuring the Kubernetes authentication method you will need to extract the ca_cert and the token from the secret.
Write a command that fetches these values and write them to files `/k8s.crt` and `/k8s.token` respectively.

```bash
# Configure kubernetes auth
kubectl get secret vault-k8s-auth-secret -n vault -o json | jq -r '.data."ca.crt"' | base64 -d > /usr/src/k8s.crt
kubectl get secret vault-k8s-auth-secret -n vault -o json | jq -r '.data.token' | base64 -d > /usr/src/k8s.token
```
</details>

<Task id="fetch_secrets">
Fetch the Kubernetes secret `vault-k8s-auth-secret` and write the `ca.crt` and `token` to files `/usr/src/k8s.crt` and `/usr/src/k8s.token` respectively.
</Task>

Now we have the details required to configure the Kubernetes authentication method. Let's
see how to configure it.
