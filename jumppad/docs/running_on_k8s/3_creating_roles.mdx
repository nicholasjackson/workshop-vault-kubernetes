# Creating Roles to associate policies with Kubernetes service accounts 

Once you have defined the policies that you want to use you need to create a role
that associates the policy with a Kubernetes service account.  The following command
creates a role called `chat` that associates the `chat` policy with the
`chat` service account in the `default` namespace.


<Task id="create_role">
Run the following command to create a role that associates the `chat` policy with the `chat` service account.

```shell
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/chat \
  bound_service_account_names=chat \
  bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
  token_policies=chat
  ttl=24h
```

</Task>

Now everything has been configured, let's create a new Kubernetes deployment
that uses the `chat` service account to authenticate to Vault and runs
the application.
