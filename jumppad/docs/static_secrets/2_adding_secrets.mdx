# Adding secrets to Vault

Let's now see how you can add a secret to Vault, a secret is simply a collection
of keys and values that are stored at a specific path.

You can find the commands for reading and writing secrets at the following location:

<Task id="adding_secrets">
Create a secret at the path `chat/config` that has a key `api_key` and value
`1234567`.
</Task>

If you need some help, you can find the solution below.

```
vault kv put kv/chat/config api_key=abc1234567
```

</details>

The KV2 engine allows secrets to be versioned, if you write the same secret again 
with a new value Vault creates a new version of the secret. Both versions are accesible
however by default only the latest is returned.
