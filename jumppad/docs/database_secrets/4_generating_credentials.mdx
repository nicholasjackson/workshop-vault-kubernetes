# Generate dynamic credentials

Finally you can generate dynamic credentials for the `writer` role. The credentials are valid for the duration 
specified in the role configuration. It is also possible to override the TTL when generating the 
credentials but you can only reduce the TTL, you cannot increase it.

### Run the following command in the terminal to generate some credentials for the `writer` role

```shell
vault read database/creds/writer
```

```shell
Key                Value
---                -----
lease_id           database/creds/writer/SS984TnCX78jOybQqmbfA0of
lease_duration     1h
lease_renewable    true
password           bmuHZS30NsoV3-OUUSLr
username           v-root-writer-79lX9T2hIoauvVJUOla7-1716724716
```

## Use the credentials to access the database

The database details are as follows:

|              |                |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| **Host**     | {{db_address}} |
| **Port**     | 27017          |
| **Database** | chat           |

Use the `mongosh` command to log into the database using the credentials you have
just created.

<p>
<details>
  <summary style=\{{ fontSize: '18px', color: 'rgb(84, 128, 178)', fontWeight: 'medium' }} >Solution: command</summary>

```shell
mongosh {{db_address}}/chat \
  -u [username] \
  -p [password] \
  --authenticationDatabase admin
```

e.g.

```shell
mongosh {{db_address}}/chat \
  -u v-root-writer-aVVXa0qoZnjZpDjhRIds-1717007642 \
  -p bmuHZS30NsoV3-OUUSLr \
  --authenticationDatabase admin
```

</details>
</p>

The database connection should succeed and you should see the following output:

```shell
Connecting to:          mongodb://<credentials>@10.100.0.180:27017/chat?directConnection=true&authSource=admin&appName=mongosh+2.2.8
Using MongoDB:          7.0.9
Using Mongosh:          2.2.8

Now that you can generate credentials and access the database, let's deploy an 
applicaton to Kuberentes that can leverage these.
