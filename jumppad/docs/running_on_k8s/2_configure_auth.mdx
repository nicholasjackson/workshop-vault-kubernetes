# Enabling and Configuring Kubernetes Authentication

First thing that needs to be done is to enable the Kubernetes authentication method.

Enabling the Kubernetes authentication method is a very similar process as you have 
completed in previous exercises. Why not take a look at the documentation and 
see if you can enable the Kubernetes authentication method.

<Task id="enable_auth">
The Kubernetes authentication method has been enabled.
</Task>

<Solution title="Solution: enable kubernetes auth">

```bash
# Enable kubernetes auth
vault auth enable kubernetes
```

</Solution>

Now that the authentication method has been enabled let's configure it.

## Configuring the Kubernetes Authentication Method

To configure the Kubernetes authentication method you 
write to the path `auth/kubernetes/config` with the three parameters that you
learned about in the previous section.

The `kubernetes_host` must be a resolvable path from the Vault server to the Kubernetes
API. In this workshop Vault is running on the same Kubernetes cluster as the API server,
you can use the internal service reference when configuring `https://kubernetes.default.svc:443`.

Besides checking that the service account token has been correctly signed, 
Vault uses the Kubernetes API to validate that the presented service account token 
is valid.  For this reason the `kubernetes_host` and `kubernetes_ca_cert` are required
when configuring the Kubernetes authentication method.

Why not have a go at configuring the Kubernetes authentication method.

Did you mange that? If not you can find the solution below.

<Solution title="Solution: configure kubernetes auth">

```bash
vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
  token_reviewer_jwt=@/usr/src/k8s.token \
  kubernetes_host="https://kubernetes.default.svc:443" \
  kubernetes_ca_cert=@/usr/src/k8s.crt
```
