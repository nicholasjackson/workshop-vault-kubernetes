# Introduction

The Vault Operator is a Kubernetes operator that simplifies the process of deploying 
and managing secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault. The operator extends the Kubernetes API 
with custom resources that allow you to synchronize secrets stored in Vault with Kubernetes.

## Configuring Authentication

To enable the operator to access the secrets in Vault you need to configure an authenticcation
method.  This is used by the secrets CRDs to authenticate to Vault and so they have access
to the relevant secrets.

The relevant parameters for the VaultAuth CRD are as follows:

- `method` - The authentication method to use.  This is going to be `kubernetes` as we have
configured the Kubernetes auth method.
- `mount` - The path where the Kubernetes auth method is mounted.  You configured
this to be the default `kubernetes` path.
- `role` - The role that the service account will use to authenticate to Vault.
- `serviceAccount` - The service account that will be used to authenticate to Vault, this 
service account must be in the same namespace as the VaultAuth CRD.
