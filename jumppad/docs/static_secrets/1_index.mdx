# Static secrets

Static secrets are the most primative type of secrets that you will use in Vault.
However, they are also incredibly useful for managing static items such as API keys
that your application requires.

In this section you will learn how you can use the static secrets or KV engine within
Vault.

## Enabling the Vault secrets engine

Before you can use the secrets engine you must first mount it, you can find 
the details on how to do this at the following location.

**HINT** You need to enable the engine at the path `kv` and
use version `2` of the engine, this requires specific parameters.

</Task>
