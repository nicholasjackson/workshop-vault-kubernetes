# Creating a Root Certificate Authority


Before you can start issuing certificates, you need to create a root certificate 
authority (CA). The root CA is the top-level certificate in a certificate chain and 
is used to sign other certificates. The root CA is used to establish trust in the 
certificates that are issued by the CA.

Vault has two main options for dealing with CA's, you can either use a self-signed 
CA or you can use an external CA. In this tutorial, we will be using a self-signed CA.

## Creating the Root CA

To create the root CA you need to use the `pki/root/generate/[name]` endpoint.

This endpoint generates a new root certificate and key pair and you can specify the
common name for the certificate and the default time-to-live (TTL) for the certificates
generated using this root.

Passing the required `commond_name` parameter sets the the common name for the root
cert.


<Task id="generate_root">

Run the following command to generate a new root certificate authority.

```shell
vault write pki/root/generate/internal \
  common_name=local.jmpd.in \
  ttl=8760h
```

</Task>

Now that you have created the root CA, let's see how to create a role for
generating leaf certificates.
