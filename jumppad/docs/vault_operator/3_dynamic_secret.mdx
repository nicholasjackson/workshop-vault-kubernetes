# Dynamic Secrets

Like `VaultStaticSecrets` to synchronise dyamic secrets like the database
secrets that you configured earlier you can use the `VaultDynamicSecret` CRD.

With a `VaultStaticSecret` the secret is periodically refreshed to ensure that
it is up to date.  With a `VaultDynamicSecret` the secret has a TTL, the operator
honors this TTL and will automatically renew the secret before it expires.

The `VaultDynamicSecret` CRD is very similar to the VaultStaticSecret CRD,
however you do not need to specify the `refreshAfter` or the `type` field.

For more information on the `VaultDynamicSecret` CRD see the API reference at:
https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/api-reference


<Task id="configure_dynamic">

Create a `VaultDynamicSecret` CRD called `vault-database-secret` that will
synchronize the dynamic credentials for the `writer` role that you configured
in an earlier section.

</Task>

Did you manage to create the `VaultDynamicSecret` CRD? If not the solution is below.

<Solution title="Solution: VaultDynamicSecret">

```shell
tee chat-dynamicsecret.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1beta1
kind: VaultDynamicSecret
metadata:
  name: vault-database-secret
spec:
  vaultAuthRef: chat-auth
  mount: database
  path: creds/writer
  destination:
    create: true
    name: chat-database
EOF

kubectl apply -f chat-dynamicsecret.yaml
```

</Solution>

## Check the secret

Once you have applied the secret to your Kubernetes cluster you can check that
the secret has been created using the following command.

```shell
kubectl get secrets
```

You should see the `chat-database` secret in the list of secrets. If you do not 
you can follow the troubleshooting steps in the previous section.

```shell
NAME            TYPE     DATA   AGE
chat-config     Opaque   2      9m24s
chat-database   Opaque   3      5s
```

You can also inspect the contents of the secret, you will see that there are 
two keys `username` and `password` that contain the dynamic credentials.

```shell
âžœ kubectl get secret chat-database -o json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "data": {
        "_raw": "eyJwYXNzd29yZCI6Ik1vQTUtYXBEMk5pZlo5Z09nQkU4IiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJ2LWt1YmVybmV0ZXMtZGVmYS13cml0ZXItMkZxcDBmNXRNNGlkQm9wNTB0Wk8tMTcxODUxNzMwNCJ9",
        "password": "TW9BNS1hcEQyTmlmWjlnT2dCRTg=",
        "username": "di1rdWJlcm5ldGVzLWRlZmEtd3JpdGVyLTJGcXAwZjV0TTRpZEJvcDUwdFpPLTE3MTg1MTczMDQ="
    },
```
