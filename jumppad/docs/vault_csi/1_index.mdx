# Vault CSI Integration

The Vault CSI secrets integration uses the CSI pattern to enable secrets to be 
synced from Vault to either a file that can be mounted as a volume or a Kubernetes
secret.

This is configured by creating `SecretProviderClass` resources that are configured
to sync Vault secrets to Kubernetes secrets referenced by a deployment or a volume
that is referenced by the deployment. 

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretProviderClass
```

Let's jump straight in and create a secret for the database credentials.
