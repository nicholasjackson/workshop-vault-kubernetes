# Testing

Let's now open the application UI in the browser and test the application.

If you open the following URL in a new browser window you should see a warning
page that the connection is not secure.

<a href="{{csi_url}}" target="_blank">{{csi_url}}</a>

This is beacause the certificate that we have issued is not trusted by the browser
as it is a self signed certificate. For your real world environments you can
distribute the CA certificate to your clients so that they trust the certificate.

However for this workshop we can ignore the warning and proceed to the application.

Click on the `Advanced` button and then click on the `Proceed to {{base_url}}
 (unsafe)` link.

You should now see the chat application UI.

Try sending a message in the chat application. You should see the message appear
in the chat window.

Congratulations you have successfully deployed a secure chat application to Kubernetes
using the Vault CSI integation. Let's do one final challenge.
