# PKI Secrets

The `VaultPKISecret` CRD is used to sync PKI secrets from Vault to Kubernetes. It
is very similar to the `VaultDynamicSecret` CRD. The details of the `VaultPKISecret`
can be found in the following documentation.

<Solution title="Solution: VaultPKISecret">

```shell
tee chat-pkisecret.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1beta1
kind: VaultPKISecret
metadata:
  name: vault-pki-secret
spec:
  vaultAuthRef: chat-auth
  mount: pki
  role: chat
  commonName: chat.local.jmpd.in
  destination:
    create: true
    name: chat-pki
EOF

kubectl apply -f chat-pkisecret.yaml
```

</Solution>

## Check the secret

After applying the VaultPKISecret, if you list the secrets in the Kubernetes cluster
you should see the `chat-pki` secret.

```shell
kubectl get secrets
NAME            TYPE     DATA   AGE
chat-config     Opaque   2      7h8m
chat-database   Opaque   3      6h59m
chat-pki        Opaque   7      67s
```

If the secret does not appear you can follow the troubleshooting steps in the previous section.

Now all of the secrets are in place let's deploy the application to Kubernetes.
