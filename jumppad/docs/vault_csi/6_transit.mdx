# Mixing Patterns

One thing you may have noticed is that with both the `Operator` pattern and the `CSI`
pattern you have not been able to integrate the Transit engine for encrypting and 
decyrpting the database. This is because the `Operator` and the `CSI` driver to not 
currently have a way to sync a Vault token or provide transparent proxy access to your
applications.

Until this feature is released you have two options to integrate Vault API access with
your application:
1. Manually code the authentication process to Vault
1. Use a mixture of the `Controller` pattern and the `Operator` or `CSI` pattern.

Since the Kubernetes cluster is already using the controller, Let's use the second option
and mix the `Operator` or `CSI` pattern with the `Controller`.

### Modify either the `csi` or the `operator` config to enable transit integration 
by adding the `annotations` that inject a transparent sidecar to the pod.

To enable Transit integration in the application you will also need to add the 
following environment variables.

```yaml
- name: USE_VAULT
  value: "true"
- name: VAULT_TRANSIT_KEY
  value: "chat"
- name: VAULT_ADDR
  value: "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
```

You should have added the following annotations to your pod.

```yaml
annotations:
  vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
  vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-enable: "true"
  vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-use-auto-auth-token : "force"
```
