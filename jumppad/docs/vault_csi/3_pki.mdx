# PKI Secrets

When using the CSI driver there is only one type of CRD for dealing with all
of Vaults different secrets. The only main difference between syncing a PKI 
secret and a Database secret using `SecretProviderClass` resources is that
you need to provide additional arguments for the `common_name`.

`SexretProviderClass` enables this through the `secretArgs` parameter

```yaml
secretKey: "certificate"
secretArgs:
  common_name: chat.local.jmpd.in
```

Create a new `SecretProviderClass` resource called `vault-pki-creds` that 
syncs the Vault secret `pki/issue/chat`. You will need to  define two objects 
one for the Vault key `certificate` and one for the `private_key`.

**Note:** If you look at the file `chat-csi.yaml` you will see that the deployment
is loading the certificates from the path `/etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem`. The path
is defined by the kubernetes mount point, however the `objectName` sets the 
filename. Make sure you set the correct object names for the deployment.

```shell
tee vault-pki-creds.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: vault-pki-creds
spec:
  provider: vault
  parameters:
    roleName: 'chat'
    vaultAddress: 'http://vault.vault.svc:8200'
    objects: |
      - objectName: "cert.pem"
        secretPath: "pki/issue/chat"
        method: "PUT"
        secretKey: "certificate"
        secretArgs:
          common_name: chat.local.jmpd.in
      - objectName: "key.pem"
        secretPath: "pki/issue/chat"
        method: "PUT"
        secretKey: "private_key"
        secretArgs:
          common_name: chat.local.jmpd.in
EOF

kubectl apply -f vault-pki-creds.yaml
```

</Solution>

With both the PKI and the Database secrets created, Let's deploy the application.
