# Transparently Proxying Requests to Vault

When we looked at the operator in the previous section we did not enable the
Transit engines encrypt and decrypt capabiliies as we had no way to pass a
Vault token so that the application could authenticate against the Vault API.

We could of course have modified the application to authneticate using the
Kubernetes service account, but one of the core principles of this workshop
was to take an exising application and integrate it without needint to modify 
any of the code.

Since the Vault controller runs an instance of Vault agent as a sidecar in each  
pod, it also has the capability to provide a local authenticated proxy to the Vault
server.  When enabled a local listener at `http://localhost:8200` is enabled in the 
pods networking. The token that is obtained from the authentication process is 
automatically added to any request dramatically simplifying your applications
API access to Vault.

The configuration of this is done by adding two annotations to the pod:

The first annotation `agent-cache-enable` enables the local listener and configures
secret caching within the proxy.  The second annotation `agent-cache-use-auto-auth-token`
configures the Vault token that the agent is using to be automatically added to
every request that is forwarded to the Vault server.

```yaml
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-enable: "true"
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-use-auto-auth-token : "force"
```
