# Controlling access to Vault using policy

Policies are used to control access to Vault.  A policy is a HCL file that defines
the paths that a token can access and the operations that can be performed on those
paths.  

For example the following policy allows access to create a dynamic 
database credential using the `writer` role and to encrypt data using the transit engine.

```javascript
path "database/creds/writer" {
  capabilities = ["read", "create"]
}
```

This policy allows access to encrypt data using the transit engine with the `chat` key.

```javascript
path "transit/encrypt/chat" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
```

Policies are often combined to create a set of permissions that can be assigned to a token.
The example application will need the correct policies to perform the following actions:

* Create dynamic database credentials using the `writer` role
* Encrypt data using the `chat` key
* Decrypt data using the `chat` key
* Ability to create PKI certificates for the `chat` role 
* Access the `kv2' secret `config`

Create a policy that allows the application to perform these actions.

You can add this policy to the Vault server using the Vault CLI took has a command called 
`vault policy` this allows you to read / write and list policy.

<Task id="create_policy">
Using the `vault policy` command create a policy with the required access and save it to a policy called `chat`.
</Task>

Did you figure it out? If not the solution is below.

```bash
vault policy write chat - <<EOF
path "database/creds/writer" {
  capabilities = ["read", "create"]
}

path "transit/encrypt/chat" {
  capabilities = ["create","update"]
}

path "transit/decrypt/chat" {
  capabilities = ["create","update"]
}

path "kv/data/chat/config" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "pki/issue/chat" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
EOF
```

</Solution>

Now let's see how you link this policy to a Kubernetes service account with a 
role.
