# PKI Secrets

Vault has the capability to generate X.509 certificates for use in your applications.
This is done using the PKI secrets engine, which is a secrets engine that can
generate X.509 certificates.

The PKI secrets engine generates dynamic X.509 certificates. With this secrets engine, 
services can get certificates without going through the usual manual process of generating 
a private key and CSR, submitting to a CA, and waiting for a verification and signing 
process to complete. Vault's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms
provide the verification functionality.

Let's see how you can enable and configure the PKI secrets engine in Vault to generate
X.509 certificates for our applications.
