# Vault Controller

In the previous section you saw how to deploy the application with the Vault Operator.
In this section you will see how to deploy the same application using the Vault Controller.

Where the Operator used CRDs to sync secrets from Vault to Kubernetes, the Controller uses
annotations on the Kubernetes resources to inject the secrets.

The most basic annotation is `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"`. This annotation
adds the Vault Agent sidecar to the pod and injects the secrets into the pod.

You also need to specify the role that the Vault Agent should use for authentication.
When the deployment is created the Vault Controller mutates the pod to include the Vault Agent
and to setup the authention with Vault. Like the Operator, the Controller uses the Kubernetes
Service Account to authenticate with Vault.

```yaml
template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: chat-controller
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: "chat"
```

<Task id="add_annotations_1">
Add the above annotations to the chat-controller.yaml file.
</Task>

Next let's see how you can add static secrets to the deployment.
