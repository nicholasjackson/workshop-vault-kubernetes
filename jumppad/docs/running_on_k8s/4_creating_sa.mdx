# Defining a Kuberentes service account

Now Vault has been configured you need to create a Kubernetes deployment that
will run your application.

The first step is to create a service account for the application.  This service
account will be used to authenticate to Vault.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: chat
automountServiceAccountToken: false
```

<Task id="create_sa">
Create a servcie account called `chat` in the `default` namespace that will 
be used to authenticate to Vault.
</Task>

Next let's see how you configure deployments for each of the different Vault Kubernetes
integrations starting with the Vault Operator.
