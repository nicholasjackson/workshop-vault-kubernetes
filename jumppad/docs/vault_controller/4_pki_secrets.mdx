# PKI Secrets

When using the Vault controller and Consul Template access to all secrets
no matter their origin is very simmilar.  With PKI secrets you will use a few
different capabilities but the concepts remain the same as the previous sections.

The first difference you will see is that for PKI secrets you need to pass a parameter
for the certificates common name.  The `with pkiCert` template declaration can
accept multiple parameters, the first is the name of the secret that you would like
to access and following this is a varadic list of optional parameters.

When creating the certificate manually you executed the following command:

```shell
vault write pki/issue/chat common_name=chat.local.jmpd.in ttl=2h
```

For the template you need to do something very similar: 

```go
{{- with pkiCert "pki/issue/chat" "common_name=chat.local.jmpd.in" "ttl=2h" -}}
```

While the templates that you have written for previous secrets have written the
value of a secret to an environments file. With certificates you need to save the
value of each certiificate to it's own file.

To enable this Consul Template has the concept of functions, one of these functions
is `writeToFile [path] [user] [group] [permissions]`, it enables you to write a value 
to the file specified by path.

You may be thinking, why not just create three templates, one for the key, one for the
certificate, and one for the certificate authroity? The problem with this approach
is that you would in effect be calling the endpoint `pki/issue/chat` three separate times
the result of this would be a certiifcate file that is not matched to the key file. 

This concept brings us to a specific requirement when rendering pki templates, even
if you wish to write the individual components to a file, you must first render the
cert, ca, and key to the template so that the values become cached. This is shown in the
line below.

```yaml
  {{ .Cert }}{{ .CA }}{{ .Key }}
```

If you do not do this then the individual `writeToFile` calls will use unique 
secrets.

Add the annotations for the secret `pki` and the template `pki` to the
chat-controller.yaml file.

Let's now look at how we can implement the Transit engine to encrypt the database 
contents.
