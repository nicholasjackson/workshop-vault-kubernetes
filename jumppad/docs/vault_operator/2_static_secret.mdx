# Static Secrets

Using the Vault operator you can synchronize secrets stored in Vault with Kubernetes.
The operator ensures that the secrets are kept up to date, any changes to the secret
in Vault will automatically be reflected in the Kubernetes secret.

Static secrets are syncronised using the `VaultStaticSecret` CRD.  With this 
CRD you can specify the path in Vault where the secret is stored, the type of secret
and the destination in Kubernetes where the secret should be stored.

Since static secrets do not have a TTL the way that the operator keeps the secrets up to date
is to periodically refresh the secret.  The `refreshAfter` field in the VaultStaticSecret CRD
below specifies how often the secret should be refreshed. The value for this exercise
is set deliberately low to demonstrate the refresh process. In a production environment
you would set this to a value that is appropriate for your use case. Whenever defining
a refresh period you should consider the impact on the Vault server and the operator. 
For example, if you have 1000 secrets that are refreshed every 60 seconds that would
mean that the operator would be making 1000 requests to Vault every minute.  This could
have an unecessary impact on the performance of the Vault server and the operator.

## Creating VaultStaticSecrets

Creation of a `VaultStaticSecret` is done by deploying a CRD to the Kubernetes cluster.
The main fields in the CRD are as follows:

- `vaultAuthRef` - The reference to the VaultAuth CRD that is used to authenticate to Vault.
- `mount` - The path where the secret is stored in Vault.
- `type` - The type of secret, this can be `kv-v1` or `kv-v2`.
- `path` - The path in Vault where the secret is stored.
- `refreshAfter` - The period after which the secret should be refreshed.

For more information on the `VaultStaticSecret` CRD see the API reference at:

<Task id="configure_static">

Deploy the following CRD to the Kubernetes cluster in the default namespace.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1beta1
kind: VaultStaticSecret
metadata:
  name: vault-static-secret
spec:
  vaultAuthRef: chat-auth
  mount: kv
  type: kv-v2
  path: chat/config 
  refreshAfter: 60s
  destination:
    create: true
    name: chat-config
```

</Task>

<Solution title="Solution: Configure VaultStaticSecret">

```shell
tee chat-staticsecret.yaml << EOF 
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1beta1
kind: VaultStaticSecret
metadata:
  name: vault-static-secret
spec:
  vaultAuthRef: chat-auth
  mount: kv
  type: kv-v2
  path: chat/config 
  refreshAfter: 60s
  destination:
    create: true
    name: chat-config
EOF

kubectl apply -f chat-staticsecret.yaml
```

</Solution>

## Check the secret

Once you apply the VaultStaticSecret CRD to the Kubernetes cluster the operator will 
synchronize the secret with the Kubernetes secret.  You can check that the secret has
been created by running the following command.

```yaml
➜ kubectl get secret                
NAME          TYPE     DATA   AGE
chat-config   Opaque   2      3s
```

If the secret does not exist you may have made a misconfiguration in your configuration.
You can check the event logs for the VaultStaticSecret CRD to see if there are any errors.

```yaml
➜ kubectl describe vaultstaticsecret vault-static-secret
```

```shell
Events:
  Type     Reason                  Age                    From                Message
  ----     ------                  ----                   ----                -------
  Warning  Unrecoverable           112s (x14 over 2m33s)  vaultClientFactory  Failed to get cacheKey from obj, err=ServiceAccount "chat" not found
  Warning  VaultClientConfigError  112s (x14 over 2m33s)  VaultStaticSecret   Failed to get Vault auth login: ServiceAccount "chat" not found
  Warning  VaultClientError        28s (x5 over 71s)      VaultStaticSecret   Failed to read Vault secret: empty response from Vault, path="kv/data/chat/config"
```

If you inspect the secret you will see that it has been created with the data from the Vault secret.
Like all Kubernetes secrets the data is base64 encoded, this secret can now be 
added to your application in the same way as any other Kubernetes secret.

```shell
kubectl get secret chat-config -o json 
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "data": {
        "_raw": "eyJkYXRhIjp7ImFwaV9rZXkiOiJhYmMxMjM0NTY3In0sIm1ldGFkYXRhIjp7ImNyZWF0ZWRfdGltZSI6IjIwMjQtMDYtMTZUMDU6MTM6MTEuODg0OTUwMTEyWiIsImN1c3RvbV9tZXRhZGF0YSI6bnVsbCwiZGVsZXRpb25fdGltZSI6IiIsImRlc3Ryb3llZCI6ZmFsc2UsInZlcnNpb24iOjJ9fQ==",
        "api_key": "YWJjMTIzNDU2Nw=="
    },
```

Next, let's see how you can do the same thing but this time using a dynamic secret to
fetch database credentials.
