# Deploying the Chat Application

If you take a look at the file `chat-operator.yaml` you will see a deployment for 
the chat application. This deployment uses the secrets that you created in 
the previous sections.

All the secrets are either mounted as files or environment variables in the
deployment. The `chat-pki` secret is mounted as a volume so that the application
can read the certificate and private key. The core benefit to using the Vault
operator is that the deployment file is completely vanilla.

```yaml
  env:
  - name: HTTP_PORT
    value: "5000"
  - name: MONGODB_SERVER
    value: "10.100.0.180"
  - name: MONGODB_PORT
    value: "27017"
  - name: MONGODB_AUTHDB
    value: "admin"
  - name: MONGODB_USERNAME
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: chat-database
        key: username
  - name: MONGODB_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: chat-database
        key: password
  - name: HTTP_TLS
    value: "true"
  - name: PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
    value: "/etc/ssl/certs/key.pem"
  - name: PUBLIC_CERT_PATH
    value: "/etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem"
  volumeMounts:
  - name: chat-pki
    mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs
    readOnly: true
volumes:
  - name: chat-pki
    secret:
      secretName: chat-pki
      items:
      - key: certificate
        path: cert.pem
      - key: private_key
        path: key.pem
```
