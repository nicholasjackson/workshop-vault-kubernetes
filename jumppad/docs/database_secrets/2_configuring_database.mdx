# Configuring the database connection

Once an engine has been enabled at a given path, you can configure it. The 
configuration options will vary depending on the type of secrets engine. 
The database secrets engine requires connection information to the database.

There are many different databases that are supported by Vault:

When configuring the database secrets engine, you need to specify the plugin name, the connection URL, 
and the allowed roles.

We will configure the database secrets engine for a MongoDB database. The connection 
URL should be in the format:
 
```
mongodb://\{{username}}:\{{password}}@10.100.0.180:27017/admin?tls=false"
```

`\{{username}}` and `\{{password}}` are template variables, the actual username 
and password are passed as parameters.

The full command looks like the folowing example:

```shell
vault write database/config/chat \
  plugin_name=mongodb-database-plugin \
  allowed_roles=writer,reader \
  connection_url="mongodb://\{{username}}:\{{password}}@{{db_address}}:27017/admin?tls=false" \
  username="root" \
  password="password"
```

If you notice in the previous command you are passing the username and password as parameters.
This is potentially a security risk, as the not only is the password hard coded in the command,
but even if you used variable substitution the password would still need to be available in 
the environment where the command runs. Wherever you have a secret there is an oppotunity 
for it to be leaked.

Vault has a solution for this, it has the ability to rotate these credentials, storing
them securtely in Vault. Let's see how this works.

## Rotating the Root Database Credentials

Once you have configured the username and password in Vault it is not possible to read this 
configuration and retrieve them, they are only used internally when generating dynamic credentials. 
However we would like to avoid the situation where the credentials are leaked at configuration
time. To acheive this you can use the `rotate-root` command to rotate the root credentials.

Vault will generate a new username and password, and update the configuration with the new
credentials. The old credentials are revoked and can no longer be used. Since the root credentials
are only used to generate dynamic credentials, this is a very simple solution to the problem.

The command to rotate the root credentials is:

```shell
vault write -force database/rotate-root/chat
```

Using the information above, configure the database secrets engine for MongoDB 
and rotate the root database credentials.
</Task>

Now the Vault has been configured with the database details, let's see how you can create roles
that grant specific permissions.
