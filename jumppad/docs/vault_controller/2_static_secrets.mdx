# Static Secrets

To inject static secrets into your application with the controller pattern you
use the annotation that can write files to the container. These files can either
be created as your application config files or they can be envrionment 
file that can be sourced by your application.

Since the example application uses environment variables for configuration
you will need to use Vault Template to create environment files
that can be sourced before application start.

To generate the files you need to use the Consul Template language, Consul
Template uses Go templating, it should be relivitvely familliar for anyone who
has created any Helm charts.

To convert the secret `kv/chat/config` to an exportable value you would write 
the below Consul template.

When referencing the secret you need to use the path for the `kv2` secret 
which includes the additional `data` path, `kv/data/chat/config`.

```go
{{- with secret "kv/data/chat/config" }}
  export api_key="{{ .Data.data.api_key }}"
{{- end }}
```

To render the template you add it to an annotation that follows the convention
`agent-inject-template-[name]`. For example should you wish to render a template
called config you would add the following annotation.

```yaml
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-config: |
  {{- with secret "kv/data/chat/config" }}
    export api_key="{{ .Data.data.api_key }}"
  {{- end }}
```

This annotation would write the file to `/vault/secrets/config`.

Finally, before you can use a secret in a template you need to reference it
in another annotation for example to use the `config` secret in the previous 
template you would need to add the following annotation:

```yaml
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-api: 'kv/data/chat/config'
```

The convention of for the name of this annotation is as follows,

```yaml
agent-inject-secret-[name]
```

Putting this all together you get the following:

```yaml
template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: chat-controller
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: "chat"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-api: 'kv/data/chat/config'
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-config: |
          {{- with secret "kv/data/chat/config" }}
            export api_key="{{ .Data.data.api_key }}"
          {{- end }}
```

<Task id="add_annotations_2">
Add the following annotations to the `chat-controller.yaml` file

```yaml
template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: chat-controller
      annotations:
        example: "annotations"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: "chat"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-api: 'kv/data/chat/config'
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-config: |
          {{- with secret "kv/data/chat/config" }}
            export api_key="{{ .Data.data.api_key }}"
          {{- end }} 
```
