# Configuring Database Credentials

When using the CSI integration you must have both the Vault Controller deployed to your
Kubernetes cluster with the CSI driver enabled. And the CSI driver itself installed to the cluster.
Both of these tasks have been configured for you and will not be covered in this section.
What you will learn is how to define secrets using the CSI integration.

CSI is a predominately a storage interface standard for kubernetes, however it also
has the capability to integrate with secrets. To use CSI with secrets you create
a `SecretProviderClass` resource as show below.

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: vault-db-creds
```

The spec allows provider plugins so handle the secret integration, for example
if you wanted to define a secret for the `database/creds/writer` secret in Vault
you could create the following spec that defines the address of Vault and the list of
objects that map a Vault parameter for a secret to a CSI secret parameter.

```yaml
spec:
  provider: vault
  parameters:
    roleName: 'chat'
    vaultAddress: 'http://vault.vault.svc:8200'
    objects: |
      - objectName: "dbUsername"
        secretPath: "database/creds/writer"
        secretKey: "username"
      - objectName: "dbPassword"
        secretPath: "database/creds/writer"
        secretKey: "password"
```

This could then be mounted to a volume using the following convention inside your
deployment file.

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: vault-db-creds
    csi:
      driver: 'secrets-store.csi.k8s.io'
      readOnly: true
      volumeAttributes:
        secretProviderClass: 'vault-db-creds'
```

Or alternately you can write the secert to a kubernetes secret, by specifying the
optional `secretObjects` section.

```yaml
secretObjects:
  - secretName: vault-db-creds-secret
    type: Opaque
    data:
      - objectName: dbUsername # References dbUsername below
        key: username # Key within k8s secret for this value
      - objectName: dbPassword
        key: password
```

<Task id="csi_database">
Create a `SecretProviderClass` called `vault-db-creds` resource that syncs the 
Vault secret `database/creds/writer` to the Kubernetes secret `vault-db-creds-secret`
</Task>

Did you manage to do that? If not the solution is below.

tee vault-db-creds.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: vault-db-creds
spec:
  provider: vault
  parameters:
    roleName: 'chat'
    vaultAddress: 'http://vault.vault.svc:8200'
    objects: |
      - objectName: "dbUsername"
        secretPath: "database/creds/writer"
        secretKey: "username"
      - objectName: "dbPassword"
        secretPath: "database/creds/writer"
        secretKey: "password"
  secretObjects:
    - secretName: vault-db-creds-secret
      type: Opaque
      data:
        - objectName: dbUsername # References dbUsername below
          key: username # Key within k8s secret for this value
        - objectName: dbPassword
          key: password
EOF

kubectl apply -f vault-db-creds.yaml
```

</details>
</p>

**Note**: When you create a `SecretProviderClass` the secret syncing is lazy,
no action is taken until you mount the secret inside a deployment. This is done
by adding a volume to your deployment that has the correct `csi` configurtation.

If you look at the file `chat-csi.yaml` you will see the following volume definition.

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: vault-db-creds
    csi:
      driver: 'secrets-store.csi.k8s.io'
      readOnly: true
      volumeAttributes:
        secretProviderClass: 'vault-db-creds'
```

Now let's take a look at how you can use PKI secrets.
